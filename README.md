### Gameplay
In this game, circles spawn at random positions on the screen. The player needs to click on them before they reach a maximum size. If a circle reaches its maximum size without being clicked, the player loses a point. Successfully clicking on a circle increases the player's score.

### Features
**Random Circle Spawning**: Circles spawn at random intervals and random positions on the screen.
**Dynamic Growth**: Circles gradually grow in size and change color based on their radius.
